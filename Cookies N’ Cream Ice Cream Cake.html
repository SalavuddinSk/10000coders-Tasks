    <h1>What Is An Ice Cream Cake?</h1>
    <p>An ice cream cake is a layer cake filled with homemade ice cream, frosted with heavy cream, and topped with ganache and cherries. It’s super simple, fun, and most likely will please everyone.

    </p>
    
    <p>The hardest part of making the cake is finding space for it in the freezer. But please note that you will need to consolidate the room for a short time because this cake will be gone in no time.

    </p>
    <p>This epic dessert is an assembly of three components: cake, ice cream, and whipped cream.

    <h1>The Cake</h1>
    <p>Bake it ahead and assemble the dessert when the cake is completely cool. I used Gemma’s Best-Ever Chocolate Cake with Chocolate Whipped Chocolate Ganache, and you can also bake Vanilla Birthday Cake or Brownie Cake.

    <h1>The Size</h1>
    <p>Eight-inch or nine-inch are both excellent options. Even though a tall cake is very impressive, the ice cream will melt faster than the cake softens, and slicing might become a messy challenge. 

    </p>
    
    <h1>The Cookies and Cream Ice Cream</h1>
    <p>You can quickly whip a homemade no-churn ice cream in 10 minutes using a stand or hand mixer.
        All you need to do is whip the cream, then fold the sweetened condensed milk and crushed Oreos. Pour into the pan (or any other mold) and freeze until solid.

    <h1>Other Flavors
    </h1>
    <p>The cake gets its flavor and texture from the crushed Oreo added. Not a fan of Cookies and Cream? No problem. Fold in whatever your heart desires. Here are some ideas:

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dulce de Leche (½ cup)</li>
        <li>Lemon Curd (½ cup)</li>
        <li>Chopped Chocolate (1 cup)</li>
        <li>Strawberry Jam (½ cup)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>The Size</h1>
    <p>When sandwiching the ice cream between two layers of cake, I like to mold the ice cream in size smaller pan. For example, if I bake the cake in two 9-inch pans, then I will use one 8-inch pan for the ice cream. This helps the ice cream from oozing out as it melts.

    </p>
    <h1>Decorating The Cake
    </h1>
    <p>You can’t go wrong with it. Frost and decorate like a pro if you are an experienced cake decorator or use a spoon or a knife to frost the cake. A naked cake is also a great option.

    </p>
    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>To release the ice cream from the pan, dip the bottom of the cake in a bowl of water. You can also use running water, but make sure to use cold water and not to wet the ice cream.
        </li>
        <li>I like to tap the maraschinos cherries over a paper towel to soak the liquids from the jar.
        </li>
    </ul>
