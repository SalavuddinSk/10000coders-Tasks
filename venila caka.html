    <h1 style="text-align: center; text-shadow: 2px 1px black;">The Vanilla Cake</h1>
    <p>With its outstanding vanilla flavor, pillowy soft crumb, and creamy vanilla buttercream, this is truly the best vanilla cake I’ve ever had. And after 1 bite, I guarantee you’ll agree.

    <p>Out of all the cake recipes on my website, there’s a glaring absence. There’s white cake with a pristine soft crumb, vanilla naked cake with a flavorful tight crumb, and checkerboard cake with a whimsical design.

    </p>
    <p>What about a classic vanilla layer cake draped in vanilla buttercream? I already have homemade vanilla cupcakes and a vanilla 6 inch cake covered and now in all its crowning glory (and after plenty recipe testing catastrophes), I present you with cake perfection:

    <h1>What Makes it the Best Vanilla Cake?</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Soft, light crumb from cake flour</li>
        <li>Fluffy from extra egg whites</li>
        <li>Buttery and cakey from creamed butter</li>
        <li>Stick-to-your-fork moist from eggs & buttermilk</li>
        <li>Extra flavor from pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Behind the Vanilla Cake Recipe</h1>
    <br>
    <p>After years of cake successes and flops, I’m confident in this homemade vanilla cake. During my recipe testing, I combined my white cake recipe and naked cake recipe. These are two reader favorites and I knew they’d be the best starting point. At first there were too many eggs and I quickly learned sifting cake flour was NOT doing any favors.

    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>You need the following power ingredients:</dt>
    </dl>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Cake Flour: If you want a fluffy and soft bakery-style vanilla cake, cake flour is the secret. The cake will be denser and heavier using all-purpose flour.
        </li>
        <li>Eggs & 2 additional egg whites: 3 whole eggs provide structure, moisture, and richness. 2 extra egg whites keep the cake light and airy. I don’t recommend using 4 whole eggs; stick to the 3 egg & 2 egg white combination.
        </li>
        <li>Baking Powder & Baking Soda: Remember the differences in baking powder vs baking soda and why we use both in some recipes? Using enough baking powder to give these layers height gave the cake a bitter aftertaste. Baking soda allows us to use less baking powder.
        </li>
        <li>Buttermilk: Buttermilk is an acidic ingredient and baking soda requires an acid to work. Plus buttermilk yields an EXTRA moist cake crumb. See recipe note about the alternative.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>How Much Frosting Between Cake Layers?
    </h1>
    <p>I always eyeball the amount of frosting between cake layers, but I measured when I decorated the pictured cake. The vanilla buttercream recipe below yields about 6 cups of frosting. I recommend you use about 1.5 heaping cups of buttercream between each cake layer and reserve the last 3 cups for outside the cake.

    </p>
    <p> <b>Cake Decoration Inspiration:</b>  For a simple look, stick with vanilla buttercream, fresh berries, and mint sprigs. You can also decorate with chocolate buttercream (I recommend the same amount from this piñata cake), rainbow sprinkles, or even beautiful buttercream flowers.
