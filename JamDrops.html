    <h1>INGREDIENTS FOR JAM DROPS
    </h1>
    <p>Our simple jam drops are made from just 6 basic ingredients: 

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>butter -</b>  you can use either salted or unsalted butter for this recipe. Soften the butter to room temperature before using.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>caster sugar -</b>  this is also known as superfine sugar and is a fine white sugar
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>egg -</b> I recommend using a large egg (approximately 60g)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>plain flour -</b> this is also known as all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>baking powder -</b> this acts as the rising agent in this recipe
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>jam -</b> you can use absolutely any kind of jam you like! Strawberry, raspberry, apricot or blueberry are all popular options. 
        </li>
